# What

My goal for this year is to get comfortable developing software, in any language for any purpose, without really leaving the terminal.

# Why

A mouse is slow, and anything typed can be more easily automated.

# How

Going to stick with VIM as my editor of choice. Going to start writing shell scripts and added them to the bashrc so they can be accessed anywhere. Going to really really do it this time baby.
